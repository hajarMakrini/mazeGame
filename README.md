# Welcome to the Maze Game Project! 🎮

Explore the depths of our 3D maze adventure crafted using SDL2 and raycasting techniques. Transforming a flat 2D map into an immersive 3D world, get ready to navigate through intricate corridors and challenge yourself to find... the non-existent exit! 🌌

## Project Purpose 🚀

This project is born out of a passion for gaming and a desire to dive into game development. By building this 3D maze game, we aimed to master fundamental game development concepts while delivering an engaging player experience in a dynamic maze environment.

## Meet the Team 🧑‍💻

- **Hajar Makrini** - Project Lead & Developer

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer):** A robust choice for multimedia integration in games.
- **C Programming Language:** Chosen for performance and low-level system control.
- **Raycasting:** Classic technique for rendering 3D graphics in a 2D space.
- **Git:** Version control to manage project history and collaboration.
- **Makefile:** Automated build processes for efficient development.

## Challenges Faced 🎯

The primary challenge was mastering raycasting to transform 2D maps into realistic 3D environments. Precise calculations and efficient coding were crucial to achieving smooth graphics and immersive gameplay.
