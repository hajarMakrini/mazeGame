# Welcome to the Maze Game Project! 🎮

Explore the depths of our 3D maze adventure crafted using SDL2 and raycasting techniques. Transforming a flat 2D map into an immersive 3D world, get ready to navigate through intricate corridors and challenge yourself to find... the non-existent exit! 🌌

## Project Purpose 🚀

This project is born out of a passion for gaming and a desire to dive into game development. By building this 3D maze game, we aimed to master fundamental game development concepts while delivering an engaging player experience in a dynamic maze environment.

## team project 🧑‍💻

- **Hajar Makrini** - Project Lead & Developer

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer):**  We chose SDL2 because it 
supports multimedia like graphics, audio, and input handling. 
SDL2 is versatile and performs well, making it a favorite for 
game developers.

- **C Programming Language:** We picked C for its performance and
 control over system resources, which are important in game
 development. Learning C also helped build a strong foundation 
in programming basics and low-level memory management.
- **Raycasting:**We used raycasting to create the 3D environment 
from a 2D map. It's a classic method in game development that makes
 3D effects in a 2D space, providing efficient and appealing 
graphics.
- **Git:** it was used for version control to manage the project's
 codebase. It made it easy to track changes, collaborate 
(if needed), and keep a history of the project's development.

- **Makefile:** The Makefile was used to automate the build 
process, ensuring the project compiled consistently and efficiently,
 reducing manual errors and simplifying the development workflow.

## Challenges Faced 🎯

The challenging part of developing my 3D maze game was 
implementing raycasting to transform a 2D map into a 3D world.
 Raycasting works by sending out rays from the player's perspective, which travel through the maze and detect walls and obstacles
